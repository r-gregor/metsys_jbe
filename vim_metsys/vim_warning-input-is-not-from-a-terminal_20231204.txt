Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal

   I am not an advanced linux user and I have a hard time wrapping my head around some new concepts. I
   recently read about xargs command and wanted to test some examples. One of them confused me like
   hell.

   The theory was this: If I can start editing a non existent file in vim (with vim someFile) and create
   it only after it is edited (with :qw) then I could use echo and xargs to do the same job:

   echo "someFile" | xargs vim

   xargs will get the output of echo from stdout and will pass it as an argument to vim. It appears
   however this leads to the following error -

     Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal

   The strangest thing is that a second after the error is printed vim will open the file but when I
   save it and exit vim my terminal is totally bugged. I need to close the tmux pane in order to fix the
   terminal. After all this the file will be created and the content will be as expected. It is obvious
   something is not right here but I have absolutely no idea why.

***
   The reason this is happening is that xargs is not opening your tty in the child process.

   This worked for me:
echo /etc/hosts | xargs -o vim
