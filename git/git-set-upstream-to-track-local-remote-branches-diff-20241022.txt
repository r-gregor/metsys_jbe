Run following command to enable tracking: git branch --set-upstream-to <remote>/branch branch
$> git branch --set-upstream-to ghjbe/main main

or: git push <remote> <branch> -u
$> git push ghjbe main -u

in all repositories: so that git status -b shows the tracking info:
$> git status -b

output:
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'ghjbe/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

Explanation:

Git status is about the repository's current status. It's built to be a
distributed version control system, which means origin is no different than any
other repository you might have as a remote. If you wanted git to diff your
files with every remote then the output could rapidly get very complex, and
chances are you don't care about most of it anyway.

So Git lets you specify upstream tracking information. You can do git branch
-vv to see the upstream for all your branches and if one does not have an
upstream set you can check it out and run git branch --set-upstream-to
origin/master for example. And whatever you've set here, does get included in
your git status output like this:

$> git status
   On branch master
   Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
      (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

If you want to see a list of files changes between two branches them you can do
something like git diff --stat origin/master...HEAD

Explanation 2:

What is an Upstream Branch?
An upstream branch in Git refers to a branch that serves as a reference point
for another branch. Typically, it’s used to track the remote branch, allowing
developers to fetch updates, compare changes, and push their commits easily.
Setting an upstream branch simplifies the process of keeping local and remote
repositories in sync.  How to Set Upstream Branches in Git?

Using the Git Push command with the “-u” option for the upstream branch.  Set

How to automatically set upstream in git?
You can automatically set upstream in Git by using the -u or –set-upstream
option with the git push command when pushing your local branch to the remote
repository. For example:
$> git push -u origin <branch name>

How to set a local branch to upstream?
To set a local branch to track an upstream branch, you can use the -u or
–set-upstream-to option with the git branch command. For example:
$> git branch -u <remote/branch name>


How to list upstream branches in git?
You can list upstream branches in Git using the git branch command with the -vv
option. This will display a list of all local branches along with their
respective tracking branches. For example:
$> git branch -vv

How to set upstream branch in git without pushing?
To set the upstream branch in Git without pushing, you can use the -u or
–set-upstream-to option with the git branch command followed by the remote and
branch name. For example:
$> git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote/branch name>

How to set upstream to a specific branch in git?
To set upstream to a specific branch in Git, you can use the -u or
–set-upstream option with the git push command followed by the remote and
branch name. For example:

git push -u origin <branch name>
