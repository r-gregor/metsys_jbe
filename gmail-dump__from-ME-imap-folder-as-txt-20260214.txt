AI Overview:

To dump Gmail emails into text format, the most effective methods include using Google Takeout for bulk
exporting to MBOX (then converting to text), using Mozilla Thunderbird with the ImportExportTools NG add-on to
save as plain text/HTML, or using third-party tools like ConverterTools or RecoveryTools for direct TXT
conversion.

Methods for Dumping Gmail to Text:
1 - Bulk Export (Recommended): Use Google Takeout to download all mail in MBOX format, then convert the MBOX
    file to individual text files using a converter tool.

2 - Mozilla Thunderbird (Free & Efficient):
  * Install Thunderbird and configure your Gmail account via IMAP.
  * Install the ImportExportTools NG add-on.
  * Right-click a folder, select ImportExportTools, and choose "Export all messages in folder" -> "Plain text
    format".

3 - Individual Emails (Manual):
  * Print to PDF: Open an email, click Print, save as PDF, then open in Word and save as .txt.
  * Copy/Paste: Copy email content and paste into Notepad.

4 - Third-Party Converters: Tools like SysTools or ConverterTools allow selecting specific folders and
    converting them directly into .txt, .doc, or .html formats.

Important Notes:
  * Attachments: Manual methods (copy/paste) do not save attachments, whereas dedicated tools often can.
  * Volume: For thousands of emails, desktop clients (Thunderbird) or specialized converter tools are more
    efficient than manual method.
